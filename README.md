#Updated code for PyBank and PyPoll:

	PyBank: most code there was created and thought of by me and the previous works I've done.

	code on line 79 i found the idea to use list and map from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7368789/convert-all-strings-in-a-list-to-integers
	given by cheeken.


	(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62909803/how-to-store-output-printed-on-terminal-console-to-a-text-file-in-python from aleksander ikleiw) gave me the idea to use
	the code starting on line 91 - 106 giving me the ideal on using the (, file = f), the other code i experimented with because the Analysis folder would not be found via 
	("Analysis", "Output.txt", "w"). so trial and error lead me to the code set up that i have now and having it sent out to the output.txt, using previous similar code i 	found a way to print the code into the terminal. This way you can have the output and have the results show in terminal.



	PyPoll: most of the code I figured out on my own or used from what i learned during PyBank.
	
	the list(set(list)) code i found at (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12897374/get-unique-values-from-a-list-in-python by lefterav).
	Showed me iterable class (set()). a little bit of trial and error work out how it actually works.
